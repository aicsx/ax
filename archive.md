Remote linuax articles!

*They were originally written in it_IT for informational purposes only (my native language) and have been recovered through import. Most likely some links will not work properly. If you are particularly interested you can open an [issue](https://github.com/aicsx/ax/issues) on the github page. Specify the article and the error (type: [date]-name:error) and remember! this section was written in remote time.*
