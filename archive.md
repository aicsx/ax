### $ cat archive.md
Remote linuax articles! 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
*They were originally written in it_IT for informational purposes only (my native language) and have been recovered through import. Most likely some links will not work properly. If you are particularly interested you can open an issue on the github page. Specify the article and the error. Remember! This section was written in remote time.*
## $ cat NOTE.md
*When I imported the archive database there were problems with the links and images. Some images have been recovered but not linked for timing. If you have problems please report with new [issue](https://github.com/aicsx/ax/issues)*
