# Bye freenode! Welcome Libera.Chat 

{% highlight bash %}
/connect irc.libera.chat/6697
{% endhighlight %}

It was clear!
I moved from IRC freenode to a new host, [Libera.Chat], 
which is run by a Swedish non-profit organisation.  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Obviously I am also in other networks. See [/contact].
