# [UmbrellaNet] â€“ The multi IRC network project 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
## About
The Umbrella IRC network is an initiative of IRC operators 
from various networks. It is an IRC network with multiple 
other IRC networks, each with their own identity and own 
website and staff. Everything is managed centrally, so any 
staff member of any network can assist people. This way, 
they could combine their chat and resources without losing 
their own identity.
## Technical
All [UmbrellaNet] servers and hubs run on enterprise hardware 
hosted in Tier 1 data centers across the world with high 
bandwidth capacity and are monitored around the clock to 
guarantee the continuity of the network.
## History
[UmbrellaNet] is an idea of a group of IRC operators to create 
a way to combine IRC networks without having to give up 
identity or having excessive politics.

## Summary
It has been a while since I joined this network.
I was invited for the first time for common interests 
in the *unix* and *security* world by a great friend.
I have had the pleasure of meeting many new friends. 
Knowledgeable and friendly people.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I was happy to be invited to link my IRC server.
