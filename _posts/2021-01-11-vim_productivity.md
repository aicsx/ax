### `$ v`

<br>
My daily use of wm like i3, spectrwm, bspwm, dwm
generated terminal abuse which slows down the
production process. Using 4 or 5 keyboard
mappings and basic plugins I solved the problem
by increasing my productivity.
<br>
This is my very simple [.vimrc](https://github.com/aicsx/ax/blob/master/files/.vimrc "https://aicsx.github.io/ax/files/.vimrc")
I share a short shoutcast, times are stretched to
show keys. The real ones are incredibly productive.

**plugins: *nerdtree, fzf, lightline***
<br>
`:wq`
<br>
*Errata corrige:*
in the screenshot, the horizontal and vertical
split are classic key bindings.
In my .vimrc they are respectively:
<br>
`Shift + v | Shift + s `
