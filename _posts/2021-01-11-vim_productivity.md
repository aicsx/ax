### `$ v `

My daily use of wm like i3, spectrwm, bspwm, dwm generated terminal abuse
which slows down the production process. Using 4 or 5 keyboard mappings
and basic plugins I solved the problem by increasing my productivity.


This is my very simple `[.vimrc](https://aicsx.github.io/ax/files/.vimrc)`


I share a short shoutcast, times are stretched to show keys. 


The real ones are incredibly productive.

**plugins: *nerdtree, fzf, lightline***

`:wq`
