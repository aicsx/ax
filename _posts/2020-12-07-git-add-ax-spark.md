### # git add [images/scrot/ax-spark.png](https://aicsx.github.io/ax/images/scrot/ax-spark.png)

In the COVID-19 time i fixed my old asus x555lab notebook with small ram upgrade and new ssd 512Gb. Now my dual boot is bsd :: linux. It's my current resource with all music apps and services. I decided it was time to take advantage of this too.



**Precautions if you use this asus model:**

MEDIATEK Corp. MT7630e 802.11bgn Wireless Network Adapter 

"device include BT module".

*linux: external dongle is required. Bluetooth issue if kernel > 4.x*

*bsd: external dongle is required.  Wireless missing driver*



**Report:** with 15-20â‚¬ you can get both and eliminate the problems. 
My  choice:

1. Tp-link TL-WN823N USB Wireless 
   
   "tested on openbsd/freebsd/netbsd - it's full compatible"

2. Plugable Bluetooth USB Adapter 4.0 LE 
   
   "tested on Slackware,Crux,Kiss,Spark,Artix,Devuan: it's full compatible" 
   
   

#### Result:

Full compatible linux laptop for my music job and full compatible *bsd laptop for my life.  

#### Suggestion:

No upcoming machine change is required. Long live my old laptop!
