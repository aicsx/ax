### $ linuax posts import :: OK

With a little patience, I restored all posts and tutorials from the old site. Deleted some articles code because they will subsequently be available on repositories. The import from wordpress to jekyll could create link problems. If you are find issues, you can report them directly to the repository and I will fix it. See summary.

> changelog
 - import posts from wordpress to jekyll	:: OK
 - / now sort posts from > 2019			:: OK 
 - new page /archive with all old linuax posts	:: OK
 - /archive sort posts from < 2020 		:: OK
 - favicon.ico					:: restored
 - remote_theme fork and applied		:: OK
