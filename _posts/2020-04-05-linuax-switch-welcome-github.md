# New minimal static site start here!

Recently I have dedicated myself to many things.
In particular, faithful to my thoughts: 
Slackware forever, but currently moved on [BSD] :: [CRUX] :: [KISS] :: [ATARAXIA]

[BSD]:  https://www.freebsd.org
[CRUX]: https://crux.nu
[KISS]: https://k1ss.org
[ATARAXIA]: https://ataraxialinux.github.io
<p>&nbsp;</p>
This leads me to create things that I need for various environments. 
I hope they can be useful, but also not. This is fine with me.
